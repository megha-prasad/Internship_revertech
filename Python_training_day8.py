# --> Functions
# functions are useful chunks of code that allow us to encapsulate task
# Encapsulation is a way to carry out a whole series of steps into a one single command
# Defining Functions
# Example of a function definition:

def cylinder_volume(height, radius):
    pi = 3.14159
    return height * pi * radius ** 2
# After defining the cylinder_volume function, we can call the function like this.

cylinder_volume(10, 3)
# This is called a function call statement.

# A function definition includes several important parts.

# Function Header
# The function header always starts with the def keyword, which indicates that this is a function definition.
# Then comes the function name (here, cylinder_volume), which follows the same naming conventions as variables.
# Immediately after the name are parentheses that may include arguments separated by commas (here, height and radius). 
# Arguments, or parameters, are values that are passed in as inputs when the function is called, and are used in the function body. 
# If a function doesn't take arguments, these parentheses are left empty.
# The header always end with a colon :.
# Function Body
# The rest of the function is contained in the body, which is where the function does its work.
#The body of a function is the code indented after the header line. Here, it's the two lines that define pi and return the volume.
# Within this body, we can refer to the argument variables and define new variables, which can only be used within these indented lines.
# The body will often include a return statement, which is used to send back an output value from the function to the statement that called the function. 
# A return statement consists of the return keyword followed by an expression that is evaluated to get the output value for the function. 
# If there is no return statement, the function simply returns None.

# Naming Conventions for Functions
# Function names follow the same naming conventions as variables.

# Only use ordinary letters, numbers and underscores in your function names. They can’t have spaces, and need to start with a letter or underscore.
# You can’t use Python's reserved words or keywords for function names, as discussed earlier with variable names. 
# Try to use descriptive names that can help readers understand what the function does.

# Default Arguments
# We can add default arguments in a function to have default values for parameters that are unspecified in a function call.

def cylinder_volume(height, radius=5):
    pi = 3.14159
    return height * pi * radius ** 2
# In the example above, radius is set to 5 if that parameter is omitted in a function call. 
# If we call cylinder_volume(10), the function will use 10 as the height and 5 as the radius. 
# However, if we call cylinder_volume(10, 7) the 7 will simply overwrite the default value of 5.

# Also notice here we are passing values to our arguments by position. 
# It is possible to pass values in two ways - by position and by name. Each of these function calls are evaluated the same way.

cylinder_volume(10, 7)  # pass in arguments by position
cylinder_volume(height=10, radius=7)  # pass in arguments by name
