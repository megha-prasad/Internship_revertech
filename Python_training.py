# --> Arithmetic operators :

#   + Addition
#   - Subtraction 
#   * Multiplication
#   / Division
#   % Mod (the remainder after dividing)
#   ** Exponentiation (note that ^ does not do this operation, as you might have seen in other languages)
#   // Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer

# *Also there are bitwise operators.
# --> Quiz: Average Electricity Bill

# My electricity bills for the last three months have been $23, $32 and $64. What is the average monthly electricity bill over the three month period? Write an expression to calculate the mean, and use print() to view the result.

print((32+23+64)/3)
print(32+64+23)

# -->Quiz: Calculate
# Two parts of a floor need tiling. One part is 9 tiles wide by 7 tiles long, the other is 5 tiles wide by 7 tiles long. Tiles come in packages of 6.

# How many tiles are needed?
# You buy 17 packages of tiles containing 6 tiles each. How many tiles will be left over?

required = ((9*7) + (5*7))      # Fill this in with an expression that calculates how many tiles are needed.
print(required)

leftov = (17*6)-required        # Fill this in with an expression that calculates how many tiles will be left over.
print(leftov)

# --> Variables : 
mv_population = 74728

# Here mv_population is a variable, which holds the value of 74728. 
# This assigns the item on the right to the name on the left, which is actually a little different than mathematical equality, as 74728 does not hold the value of mv_population.
# whatever term is on the left side, is now a name for whatever value is on the right side. 
# Once a value has been assigned to a variable name, you can access the value from the variable name.
