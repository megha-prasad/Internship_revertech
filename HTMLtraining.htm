<!-- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language 
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc

simple html program:--> 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

<!-- The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
<br> doesn't have an end tag. These elements are called empty elements
The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.
A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.

HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:-->
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

<!--The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. 
Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.

HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:-->
<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">

<!-- HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag.
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.

All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:

Example-->
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

<!-- The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:

Example-->
<img src="img_girl.jpg">

<!--There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: -->
src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

<!--2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. 
If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page.
Example:--> 
src="img_girl.jpg". 
<!--If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".
The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specifies the width and height of the image (in pixels):

Example-->
<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">
<!--
The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image.-->
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">

<!--The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

Example-->
<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

<!--You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
The following example specifies English as the language:-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
<!--Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. 
So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.
The following example specifies English as the language and United States as the country:-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>

<!--The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:
Example-->
<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>

<!--The HTML standard does not require quotes around attribute values.But it is recommended to use quotes
Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.
In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:-->
<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>
<!--Or vice versa:-->
<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">
 
<!--Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property:
Example-->
<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>

<!--You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different result.
With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.

The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page.
The <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.-->

<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>

<!--The HTML <br> element defines a line break. Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph.
The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text. The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
-->
<pre>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>

<!--Setting the style of an HTML element, can be done with the style attribute.
The HTML style attribute has the following syntax:-->

<tagname style="property:value;">
<!--The property is a CSS property. The value is a CSS value.

=>Background Color
The CSS background-color property defines the background color for an HTML element.
Example
Set the background color for a page to powderblue:-->

<body style="background-color:powderblue;">

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
<!--Example
Set background color for two different elements:-->

<body>

<h1 style="background-color:powderblue;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="background-color:tomato;">This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
  
<!--Text Color
The CSS color property defines the text color for an HTML element:
Example-->
<h1 style="color:blue;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>

<!--Fonts
The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used for an HTML element:
Example-->
<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="font-family:courier;">This is a paragraph.</p>

<!--Text Size
The CSS font-size property defines the text size for an HTML element:
Example-->
<h1 style="font-size:300%;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="font-size:160%;">This is a paragraph.</p>

<!--Text Alignment
The CSS text-align property defines the horizontal text alignment for an HTML element:
Example-->
<h1 style="text-align:center;">Centered Heading</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">Centered paragraph.</p>
  
<!--HTML Formatting Elements
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

<b> - Bold text-The HTML <b> element defines bold text, without any extra importance.
<strong> - Important text-The HTML <strong> element defines text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold.
<i> - Italic text-The HTML <i> element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.
<em> - Emphasized text- The HTML <em> element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.
<mark> - Marked text-defines text that should be marked or highlighted
<small> - Smaller text
<del> - Deleted text-defines text that has been deleted from a document. Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text.
<ins> - Inserted text-defines a text that has been inserted into a document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text
<sub> - Subscript text-Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H2O
<p>This is <sub>subscripted</sub> text.</p>
<sup> - Superscript text-Superscript text appears half a character above the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Superscript text can be used for footnotes, like WWW-->
